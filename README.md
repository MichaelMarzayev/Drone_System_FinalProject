# Smart Drone System 🚀

Final project – End-to-end autonomous drone system  
Flight controller on ESP32 | Ground station on Raspberry Pi 5 | Tablet control interface

Developed in collaboration with @yonizvida

---

## Technologies
- **C++** (ESP32 Firmware)
- **Python** (Ground Station)
- WebSocket / TCP/IP Communication
- PID & Kalman Filter for flight stabilization
- MIT App Inventor (Tablet interface)
- Embedded hardware integration (IMU, motors, ESC, LiPo battery, F450 frame)

---

## Experiments & Results
- Sensor calibration and WebSocket communication testing
- PID + Kalman-based stabilization algorithms
- Full flight tests: stable hovering, high responsiveness, and real-time telemetry

---
