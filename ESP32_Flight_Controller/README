# ESP32 Flight Controller & Main System Controller

## Overview
In this project, the ESP32 is used as an autonomous flight controller and as the main system controller of the drone.
It is responsible for executing all core operations of the UAV, including real-time control, system coordination, and communication handling.

## Controller Architecture
The controller architecture is designed to run on two parallel cores of the ESP32.
This multi-core approach enables:
- Real-time flight control
- High execution speed
- System stability
- Reliable inter-module communication

Task separation across the two cores allows deterministic behavior and improved system responsiveness, which are critical for autonomous flight applications.

## Communication System
The system utilizes real-time communication protocols to enable reliable data exchange between all system components.
These protocols are used for:
- Sensor data transmission
- Command and control signals
- Communication between processing units and peripheral modules

The communication architecture is designed to support low latency, high reliability, and synchronized operation across the entire system.

## Project Role
The ESP32 acts as the central processing unit of the drone, managing flight logic, sensor data processing, real-time communication, and coordination between system modules.
